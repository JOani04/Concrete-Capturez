      <p>
        Welcome to Concrete Capturez. This portfolio showcases my strongest work with an emphasis on
        sports action and landscape images. The goal is simple: clean composition, strong timing, and
        photos that feel alive.
      </p>

      <p>
        Concrete Capturez focuses on <strong>sharp timing</strong>, <em>clean composition</em>, and
        <mark>consistent editing style</mark> across sports and landscapes.
      </p>

        For inspiration and industry examples, I study
        <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/"
           title="Visit National Geographic Photography for professional photo stories and galleries">
           National Geographic Photography galleries

        <h3>Current Highlight</h3>
        <p>
          Right now I’m focusing on capturing peak athletic moments—impact, motion, and emotion—while also
          building a landscape collection that emphasizes depth, light, and atmosphere. As this site grows,
          each category will include full galleries and featured collections.

    <section id="sports">
      <h2>Sports Photography</h2>

      <h3>Action and Timing</h3>
      <p>
        Sports photography is about anticipation. I aim to capture decisive moments with sharp focus,
        controlled framing, and a perspective that puts the viewer in the action.
      </p>

      <h3>What you’ll find here</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Match and event highlights</li>
        <li>Practice and training coverage</li>
        <li>Close-ups, intensity, and emotion shots</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="landscape">
      <h2>Landscape Photography</h2>

      <h3>Light, Space, and Detail</h3>
      <p>
        My landscape work focuses on mood and composition—big scenes with clear structure, strong lines,
        and lighting that creates depth.
      </p>

      <h3>What you’ll find here</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Wide scenic views and natural textures</li>
        <li>Golden hour and dramatic weather shots</li>
        <li>Minimal compositions with strong contrast</li>
      </ul>

      <aside class="panel">
        <h3>Coming Soon</h3>
        <p>
          I will be adding separate gallery pages for Sports and Landscape, plus a “Best Of” page that
          highlights my strongest images across both categories.

    <section id="about">
      <h2>About Concrete Capturez</h2>
      <p>
        Concrete Capturez is my photography brand and portfolio. This website is also my CS 125H term
        project, so it will improve each week as I add galleries, navigation, and additional pages while
        keeping a clean HTML5 structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        My priority is delivering images that feel intentional—strong framing, strong lighting, and a
        consistent style across shoots.

          Built the first version of the Concrete Capturez home page using semantic HTML5 structure,
          correct heading hierarchy, and placeholder sections for Sports and Landscape galleries.
